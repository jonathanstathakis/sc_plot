A CLI app to produce plots of specified wavelengths from spectrum-chromatogram data store in a duckdb database generated by [wine_analysis_hplc_uv/build_library](https://github.com/jonathanstathakis/wine_analysis_hplc_uv).

Refer to [this brief](../notes/mres_logbook.md#plot-cli-app) regarding the motivation for this project.

TODO:

- [ ] setup base project with poetry
- [ ] install wine_analysis_hplc_uv
- [ ] setup github repo
- [ ] find query modules for getting the data
- [ ] find plotting modules for plotting the data
- [ ] establish CLI interface
- [ ] test
- [ ] optional: try and get plotting going within the terminal rather than browser.
